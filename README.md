# giflog

Because gifs or it didn't happen

This is a script designed to scrape images from static URLs and save them
locally with a local unique (datestamped) name, for either long term archiving
of otherwise short-lived images, and/or further analysis/processing (eg:
creation of gifs)

Features include

* generating html of various forms (per-day, per month, etc)
* post-processing of images (imagemagick options)
* decoding base64 images from html
* Probably more

This readme written up in Dec 2023, at time of git repo creation, pulling in
old versions from backups - the oldest found being Jan 2015 (evidence of saved
images reveals this script began Oct 2012)
